The Numbeo website (www.numbeo.com) provides access to a variety of data. One table lists prices of certain items in selected cities around the world. They also report an overall cost-of-living index for each city compared to the costs of hundreds of items in New York City. In the data file Cost_of_living_2013.txt included are the Cost of Living Index, a Rent Index, a Groceries Index, a Restaurant Price Index, and a Local Purchasing Power Index that measures the ability of the average wage earner in a city to buy foods and services. All indices are measured relative to New York City, which is scored 100.
